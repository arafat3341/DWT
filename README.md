# Bright Star Grading System
Bright Star Grading System is a project for the final exam of “Datenbanken und Web-Techniken”. This 
project is targeted for the advanced online student grading system managed by school. In this project, 
a simple grading system is developed where teachers and students can find information about classes, 
subjects, and test grades. There were various other functionalities implemented according to the 
project requirements.

## Primary Requirements
The primary requirement of the project is to build a system where there must be a local database, 
which is communicated through API by the use of a backend. There should also be a frontend just to 
provide a user interface to the end users. The front end never communicates directly with the 
database

## Relational Schema
Relational schema denotes to the meta-data that describes the erection of data within a convinced 
domain. A relational schema for a database is the framework of how data is prearranged. It typically 
stipulates which columns in which tables comprise orientations to data in other tables, frequently by 
comprising primary keys from other table so that rows can be easily joined.

Relational schema has a very important role for developing the project. First we did this relational schema even before starting to write program. Because relational schema helps us to understand how the tables of the database are connected to each other using foreign key and primary key.

## Functionalities
This project is mainly consisting of three user interfaces. The main interface is for the admin and the 
other two is for teachers and students. According to the requirements of the project
- All the data were stored in a database and no additional storages were used.
- The frontend communicates with the backend using API routes and finally the backend 
communicates with the database to run the system

## Project operations
This project is mainly consisting of three user interfaces. The main interface is for the admin and the other two is for teachers and students. According to the requirements of the project, all the data were stored in a database and no additional storage were used. 

## Conclusion
This project “Bright Star Grading System” is an API based project where most of the functional logic was implemented in the backend which was communicated by an API with the database. Working on this project was entirely a new experience for me. Implementing logics and fetching them using API to cast on the interface without writing any logic in the frontend was a bit challenging at start. But day by day, I learned, and things got easier. This project was cordially created to help the cause to create a simple grading system for schools.
